## Description:

**Cyber City** is a mobile role-playing game designed to educate users, especially seniors and non-technical individuals, about the dangers of social engineering and cybersecurity threats.

In today’s digital world, cybercriminals frequently target unsuspecting individuals, with social engineering scams being among the most common and devastating. Too often, people learn these lessons the hard way—either by falling victim themselves or witnessing others do so.

To address this growing problem, our project uses gamification and role-playing scenarios to immerse players in real-world cybersecurity challenges. Through interactive gameplay, players will experience firsthand how social engineering scams unfold, helping them recognize the warning signs and take proactive steps to protect themselves before it's too late.
